Ordering machine for fastfood restaurants.

One of the latest trends is the use of kiosks to order food at restaurants. Kiosks are self-service devices that allow customers to browse menus, customize their orders, pay with various methods, and receive their food faster and more conveniently. 

Our project aims to create an app for food restaurants that want to implement kiosks in their business. Our app will simulate a user-friendly interface, a payment system, a flexible customization option, and a seamless integration with the restaurant’s kitchen and inventory. Our app will also offer features such as loyalty programs, feedback surveys, and personalized recommendations to enhance customer loyalty and retention. Our app will be compatible with different types of kiosks, such as touch-screen, voice-activated, or QR-code based.
